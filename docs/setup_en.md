# Pikmin 2 Archipelago Setup Guide
## Required Software
- Dolphin Emulator: https://dolphin-emu.org/download/
- Archipelago: https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago/releases
- Pikmin 2 APWorld: https://github.com/chpas0/Pikmin2Archipelago/releases
- A Pikmin 2 USA .iso file
## Installing the APWorld
Put the pikmin2.apworld file in the ```custom_worlds``` folder of your Archipelago installation. You can also just double-click the file to automatically install it.
## Configuring the YAML file
### What is a YAML file and why do I need one?
Your YAML file contains a set of configuration options which provide the generator with information about how it should generate your game. Each player of a multiworld will provide their own YAML file. This setup allows each player to enjoy an experience customized for their taste, and different players in the same multiworld can all have different options.
### Where do I get a YAML file?
Once you've installed the apworld, you can generate a yaml using the ```Generate Template Options``` button in the ArchipelagoLauncher. It can be found in ```Players/Templates``` after you have done so. The name of the file will be ```Pikmin 2.yaml```.

If the .yaml file is missing in your ```Players/Templates``` folder, then please go through the apworld installation steps again, and double check that everything was done correctly.

**IMPORTANT NOTE: The .yaml file has multiple options under ```Item & Location Options```, these are all untested and may not work as intended.**

## Generating a Multiworld Game
### Step 1
Place all of the players' ```.yaml``` files into the ```Players``` folder of your Archipelago installation (NOT the ```Players/Templates``` folder).
### Step 2
Open the Archipelago Launcher (```ArchipelagoLauncher.exe```) and click the "Generate Button". If the generation succeeds, this should create a ```.zip``` archive in the ```output``` directory of your Archipelago installation.
### Step 3
Unzip the archive that was just generated. There should be a ```.json``` file inside called ```pikmin2_<seed>_<player_name>.json```. This file will be referred to as the Pikmin 2 setup file for the rest of the guide.
### Step 4
Run the ```patcher.exe``` executable that was included with the Pikmin 2 APWorld release. It will prompt you for the Pikmin 2 setup file (the ```.json``` file from Step 3) and the Pikmin 2 USA .iso file. It will output a patched version of the game to the same directory that the executable is in, called ```pikmin2_<seed>.iso```.
### Step 5
Re-open the Archipelago Launcher, and click the ```Pikmin2Client``` button. You will be prompted for the patched Pikmin 2 .iso file and the Pikmin 2 setup file. If this is your first time running the client, you will also be asked for your Dolphin executable file and your Dolphin save directory (usually ```C:/Users/<username>/AppData/Roaming/Dolphin Emulator/GC/USA/Card A```); these paths will be saved to your ```host.yaml``` so you don't need to select them each time.
### Step 6
The client and an instance of Dolphin should launch. You can then connect to the Archipelago server!

**IMPORTANT NOTE: If either the client or the Dolphin instance are closed, you must close the other one. Items obtained while the client is closed will be lost!**

## Hosting a Multiworld Game
You can upload the generated ```.zip``` file [here](https://archipelago.gg/uploads) to launch a server.

**IMPORTANT NOTE: You must delete the ```.json``` file (setup file) from the .zip archive before uploading it, otherwise the server will not launch.**

## Playing the Game
There are a few important quirks that must be observed when playing.
- You must use the leftmost file slot, otherwise the passed data will get overwritten and the client will not be able to properly read the items. To be extra safe, you may also want to clear out the other save slots.
- Due to the way the game is programmed, linking does not work on Day 1. Any items received while you are playing Day 1 will be queued and received on Day 2 once the client is linked to the game. The treasure obtained on Day 1 will also be sent once linking occurs.
- Items can only be received if the player is in a cave or on the overworld (and not on Day 1 as previously mentioned). Items cannot be received on the world map, end of day screens, or any time the player doesn't have control.
- Items take some time to be received by the game, so if there is a large queue of items it may take a bit for all of them to be processed. This is completely normal!
- The game will freeze for a split second when picking up a treasure - this is also normal. In addition, certain off-world items obtained in caves will not bring up the treasure collect screen due to the way they are implemented. 
- Off-world items in caves will respawn after being collected. Collecting them a second time won't do anything.
- Off-world items are all worth 0 Pokos. The only exception to this is if an off-world item appears in the Day 1 treasure spot (Courage Reactor) - if this occurs, the off-world item will be worth 1 Poko because otherwise the game will not register that treasure has been collected and the day will never end. 
- There may be some treasures that cannot fit under the branch in the Valley of Repose, causing impossible seeds. If you encounter this, please report them to me. If this occurs on Day 1, you can perform the [Day 1 Extinction glitch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOR6Gzgu9LU) to (possibly) save the seed.
- If you ever quit and relaunch the game and then look at your save file, the displayed poko count, treasure count, and play time may/should be filled with garbage data (really big numbers). These values are only for display and will not affect your game.
- While you are able to collect enemy corpses to repay the debt if you want, the randomizer's logic should ensure that the debt is repayable without collecting any enemy corpses.
