# Pikmin 2

## What does randomization do to this game?

All treasures are shuffled to different locations, except for the five treasures that the Titan Dweevil drops (Flare Cannon, Monster Pump, Shock Therapist, Comedy Bomb, and King of Bugs).

## What items and locations get shuffled?

Any location that contains a treasure, including those in caves, are included in the pool, except for those on floor 14 of Dream Den (Titan Dweevil treasure drops). There are a total of 196 randomized locations.

## What is the goal of Pikmin 2 when randomized?

By default, the goal is to beat the Titan Dweevil and collect Louie (King of Bugs). The goal can be changed to collect a certain number of treasures or to collect a certain number of Pokos.

## Which items can be in another player's world?

Any of the items which can be shuffled may also be placed into another player's world.

## What does another world's item look like in Pikmin 2?

Any item from another world currently looks like a marble with the AP logo inside it, made by fracta1fa1th.

## When the player receives an item, what happens?

The game will process the received treasure and add its value to the Poko count. If the treasure is part of the Explorer Kit, the player will immediately gain access to the upgrade. If the player is in the overworld, the game will notify the player every 1000 Pokos, as in vanilla. If the player is in a cave, the Poko count will come up in the top right corner of the screen and actually show the Pokos being added to the counter (this happens in vanilla if an enemy corpse is collected).
